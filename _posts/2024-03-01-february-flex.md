# February Month End - 50K here we come

February was fucking awesome. The only way I can explain my feelings after this monthly recap is that they’re akin to Thanos’ at the end of Infinity War when he’s watching the sunset knowing he won. February has been my best month ever in terms of performance and the fact that January was so crushing made this month that much sweeter. I’m going to go over my biggest winners this month along with my portfolio forecasting plan that I’ve been using since October.

My largest gains came from call debit spreads where you buy a call that is more expensive than the one you sell meaning there is a net debit that you pay to enter the position. Both calls must have the same expiration date and the difference between the strike prices of the calls is the spread. With my SQ spread (Block) I sold the $73 Call for $1.95 and bought $68 for $3.85, so I had a net debit of $1.90 which was my purchase price; because the distance between $68 and $73 is a $5 spread, since an options contract represent 100 shares you multiply by 100. To figure out your break even point you add the debit you paid to enter the position to the strike price of the call you bought, since I bought the $68 call you add $1.9 to yield a breakeven price of $69.90 for the position. If the stock price stays above the strike price of the call you sold at expiration you receive the maximum profit which is $310 per position. To determine the maximum profit you take the size of the spread which is $500 (100 * (73-68)), and subtract the debit you paid which is $190 (100 * (3.85-1.95)) you get a maximum profit of $310 per position. I cashed out of call debit spreads on Nvidia, Zoom, and Block with near max profit on all of them.

Call debit spreads were my big cash cow this month. I profited off of debit spreads on Nvidia, Zoom, and Block by positioning myself to profit off of earnings announcements. In addition to these big winners my standard put credit spreads and short puts on companies like Google, Palantir, Amazon, QQQ, and SPY magnified my gains; these types of positions represent the backbone of my portfolio, there will always be put credit spreads and short puts, as for debit spreads I need to time those very specifically in order to profit so you won’t see them as frequently.

I have been working on an excel spreadsheet that I can use to forecast my portfolio growth and compare that forecast to my actual portfolio performance. My forecast assumes that my portfolio will appreciate by 5% a month on average with cash deposits of $1000 a month except for the first month which was $3,000. 5% a month on average is optimistic and difficult, if someone tells you otherwise they don’t know what they’re talking about. My goal is to hit 50K in my portfolio, and my forecast predicts December 1st 2024 to be the first month where my portfolio starts the month over 50K. Since my performance for the last four months had been under 5% I decided that I would need to increase my cash deposits to my portfolio each month which is why the minimum deposit each month is $2000. Since tracking my portfolio like this my best month saw gains of 2.03% until now where I saw gains of 21.43% in February. The furthest deviation between my performance and my forecast was on November 1st where my portfolio was $599.68 under my forecast, now March 1st is the largest deviation where my portfolio is $5,389.99 above my forecast. I’m so proud of myself for making all of this progress and I’m really starting to feel like I have a strategy moving forward. As for my support system I love you all so much, my girlfriend and parents have to deal with my shitty mood when I get crushed by the market and they’ve been there when I need them, I couldn’t have done this without you.
