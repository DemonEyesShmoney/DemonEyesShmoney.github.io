# Netflix and Sports Broadcasting

I just found today January 23rd that Netflix plans to incorporate WWE into their broadcasting, with WWE and the UFC now being under the banner of TKO group holdings. I wonder if the UFC or other sports could at least partially move to Netflix. Since Netflix’s earnings call is today after the market closes will this news impact the earnings? The short answer is probably not, because this stuff is likely already priced in where large institutional investors already drove the stock up since the last three months have seen a 21.15% increase in Netflix’s stock price. Additionally, it is unlikely that the revenue would even be captured in this earnings call. This is news that I think is extremely important for the long-term growth of Netflix but less important for anything today. 

Earnings are all about expectations, and Netflix is a company that typically meets its earnings expectations, however, I’ve seen Netflix jump and plummet upon earnings being revealed. Although it is likely Netflix will move, the direction is very difficult to interpret. Lately I have been bearish on Netflix, but closed some of my positions due to over exposure. 

I like trading Netflix because you can make significant returns by using spreads, without having to buy the expensive stock. Spreads are an options strategy that can be used in four primary ways with a combination of puts and calls. I’ll discuss puts and calls often, and I’ll do an entire post on them in the future but for now I’ll keep it simple. Both puts and calls represent the exposure to 100 shares of an underlying security for a predetermined period of time. If you buy a call you want the stock to go up, if you buy a put you want the stock to go down. If you sell a put you want the stock to go up, and if you sell a call you want it to go down.

I was using a call credit spread to bet the stock would go down. A call credit spread allows you to sell a call that is more expensive than the one you are buying so you collect a credit, but you risk a maximum loss if the stock price goes higher than the strike price of the call you bought. The strike price is the price you’re betting on so in this case, I was betting Netflix would stay below $520 as of this Friday, if it did I would collect my entire net premium  of $120 ($1.2 * 100 shares for calls and puts) from selling the $520 call. However, if Netflix went above $525 I would receive a maximum loss of $500 because the SPREAD of $520 to $525 is $5 * 100 (100 shares for calls and puts) = $500. I had two of these call credit spreads so I was risking $1000 for the $240 I made in premium, I decided to close my position because I am uncertain of the outcome of the earnings call. I closed my position by buying it back, luckily the spread was valued at $1.19 so I essentially broke even; the amount I bought back canceled out what I made on the premium. My portfolio is a little over $23,000 so losing $1000 on a bet I've had low confidence in is too great of a risk for me. 

I currently have two other call credit spreads that expire February 16th; that position I’m more confident in because the call I sold has a strike price of $530 and the one I bought has a strike price of $535. Since Netflix is currently valued at $489.60 on Robinhood I think that even if the stock booms after earnings there's still a high chance of a sell off before the position expires which is why I kept this position open instead of the call credit spread that expires Friday since it’s comparatively very unlikely there is a sell off by then if Netflix shoots up in price. If Netflix stays the same or goes down my profits will be less because I closed half my position, but remember not to expose yourself too much in one position, I’d rather lose $1000 by mid-February than $2000.

In the future we’ll talk more about what I plan on doing with Netflix after earnings.
