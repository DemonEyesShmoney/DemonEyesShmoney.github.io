# UFC 299 Results and the TSM Casino

It’s so sad seeing Francis lose like that, he got completely outclassed by Joshua, and he just couldn’t keep up with the speed. Chito was completely underwhelming, he barely threw anything and was just a punching bag for five rounds. As for Poirier, the hero of the story won, he saved the weekend he won by devastating knockout after jumping like five or six guillotines. People just can’t box with Poirier, if you try you’ll probably just end up in a highlight video. He's too slick and it’s like magic. He lands perfect shots with perfect technique and I’m glad to see that his chin held up and that he had to fight against adversity for most of the fight. Also props to JDM for timing a perfect knee to finishing Burns late in the third and I’m happy to see Yan back in the win column

My picks were really accurate but Francis’ devastating knockout loss was just soul crushing the path he paved is already incredible but if he beat Joshua it would’ve changed everyone's perspective on MMA fighters going into boxing. Unfortunately we’re back to reality and the boxer won the boxing fight.

## Green is the right winner and method of victory, yellow is just the winner was right, and red is wrong.

As for the portfolio, dark times have befallen the land. I'm currently gambling on a stock called Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), it was recommended to me by my friend Eric and I’ve foolishly disregarded risk mitigation and diversification. If you are developing a portfolio, remember to diversify and be smart with position sizing. I have a position that is a combination of stocks, spreads, and calls totaling 20K but I will be reducing that position this week. On Friday I got too excited, my portfolio hit an all time high of 39K, but by the time the market closed I went from up $4,500 to down $2,500. I got carried away with the prospect of hitting big and didn’t listen to my better judgment. I'm hoping I’ll be able to salvage this mistake by minimizing my position early in the week. Everyone can make mistakes, but when it comes to your wealth it’s always better to grow slowly than try to hit big and lose it all in one go. 

# Just remember to stay calm and stay patient

Just like always I’m not a financial advisor, this isn’t financial advice.
