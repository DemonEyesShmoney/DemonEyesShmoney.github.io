# Main Card

### Alex Pereira vs Jamahal Hill [Certainty: 60%]

I smell a surprise, Jamahal by KO: Alex has fought amazing competition and I think he’s a better striker than Jamahal, but Alex has never fought someone in MMA with power like Jamahal. I think Pereira could definitely get caught whilst throwing a flurry. Alex’s flurries likely will be what wins him the fight but it opens him up to taking big shots. Jamahal’s best weapon in his fight with Glover has his head kick, it was so fast and kept landing, if he can land it on Pereira it’ll get Alex’s respect, but Jamahal has to be aware that Alex might have prepared for it so if it doesn’t work he should move away from using it in this fight.

### Weili Zhang vs Yan Xiaonan [Certainty: 85%]

Weili by dominant decision: Weili is amongst the most well rounded fighters right now she can get a finish anywhere and I see her being able to maneuver around difficulty, if Yan can get her in trouble on the feet I can see Weili switching to grappling and dominating Yan there. I think Yan is going to be way too 1 dimensional in the cage and be running trying to counter.

### Justin Gaethje vs Max Holloway [Certainty: 15%]

Gaethje will probably win a brutal decision beatdown but I’m taking Max by anything: I think Max is going to surprise us. I think he’ll be able to outweigh Gaethje’s power with overwhelming volume, I think his chin will be fine, I think he’s going to be faster. Max needs to check some kicks for once, keep up the volume, avoid reckless trades, land one or two takedowns, use knees, use elbows, and absolutely not get hit by Gaethje after a break from a clinch.

### Charles Oliviera vs Arman Tsarukyan [Certainty: 50%]

Although I’m getting the Charles fight week butterflies I’m going Oliviera by SUB: Oliveira is more dangerous on the feet and the ground, he can drop Arman and sub him like he did to Gaethje or ground and pound like he showed with Beniel. If Arman stays composed and doesn’t crumble under Oliviera’s offense he definitely has the skills to beat Charles. I could see Arman by KO/TKO or even winning a decision, but Charles has shown time after time that he pushes ahead and gets the finish. I think much of the respect for Arman is coming from his finish of Beniel and his performance against Islam which is warranted, but I think Charles as an underdog is a great bet.

### Bo Nickal vs Cody Brundage [Certainty: 100%]

BO Nickal by anything: He needs to win this one, the UFC is pushing him so hard and it just feels fake. This is definitely a free fight for Bo and if he loses he’ll never place on a pay per view again.

# Prelims

### Jiří Procházka vs Aleksandar Rakić [Certainty: 80%]

Jiří by decision: I think he's levels above Rakić on the feet and with Rakić coming off the leg injury his grappling is going to be a shadow of what it was. I think with the ability to get Jiří down it could be more competitive but with his injury I think Rakić will be a deer in headlights. Rakić’s most deadly weapon is going to be his right body and head kick, if he can get a few good body kicks in and open up the headkick he can possibly finish Jiří.

### Calvin Kattar vs Aljamain Sterling [Certainty 70%]

Kattar KO/TKO Round 3: I think Calvin is going to be big enough to stay up or at least get back up. Aljo is coming off of a KO loss and my guess is Calvin has heavier hands than O’malley. Aljo tends to be reckless in his  striking and Kattar absolutely dismantled Giga when they fought and Giga is a far more effective striker than Aljo.
 
### Holly Holm vs Kayla Harrison [Certainty: 60%]

Holly Holm KO/TKO: Holly is definitely going to be the best Striker Kayla has ever seen. Kayla is powerful and an excellent grappler but I think she’ll be in danger the whole fight whereas Holly is in danger on the ground. Holly is a little over the hill, but I think she’s fought enough people who have tried to take her down that she knows what to expect. I think it could be a similar looking fight to her fight with Ronda.

### Sodiq Yusuff vs Diego Lopes [Certainty: 70%]

Lopes by SUB: He is super exciting and skilled. I really hope he continues to push into the featherweight division. Sodiq is a good fighter, but Barbosa was able to beat him over five rounds in a fight he was losing by having better fight IQ, incorporating clinching, grappling, and surviving nearly being finished. If Lopes is going to get far in the featherweight division he’s going to have to run through Sodiq.

# Early Prelims

### Jalin Turner Renato Moicano [Certainty: 40%]

Moicano by decision:  I’m not sure about this one but Jalin Turner really relies on his length and he isn’t the same guy when he’s on the ground or when he’s tired. He can finish Moicano but as the fight goes on the worse he’ll look.

### Jéssica Andrade vs Marina Rodriguez [Certainty: 95%]

Rodriguez KO/TKO: This is going to go like Andrade’s fight with Yan Xiaonan where Andrade tries to blitz forward and get caught with a big counter. Rodriguez has some clean, powerful boxing, and she will definitely have the range. Andrade’s chin isn’t what it used to be and I don’t see her dominating Marina on the ground.

### Bobby Green vs Jim Miller [Certainty: 60%]

Jim Miller by SUB: I see Jim hurting Bobby and finishing it on the ground with a sub, if he tries to box with Bobby, I see Jim getting humiliated Bobby has the cleanest shoulder roll in the division.

### Deiveson Figueiredo vs Cody Garbrandt [Certainty: 85%]

Figgy by KO: This one is tough to swallow because I want Cody to smoke him because it would be an amazing win on his resume but he’s gonna leave his chin on display, guys with light hands like Kai were able to KO Cody, Figgy 100% has the power. Cody is gonna go crazy and get caught but I hope I’m wrong.
