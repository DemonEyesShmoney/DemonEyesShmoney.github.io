## Data Dropped

Although this project is in its earliest stages I want to keep you all updated on the progress and show you how to make these reports for yourselves along with the uses for them. In addition to current features I’ll be discussing the future of this project and what I want to add. Unfortunately I was unable to capture the entire month because as soon as I thought of the idea I began working. If you want to make the spreadsheets for securities of your own choice or your own portfolio you can use the same equations, update the dates and the securities, then replace the orange fields with the appropriate numbers for your chosen securities.

As of right now the project is two-fold, the reports themselves and the yahoo finance screenshots. The reports at the moment use the open, the close, bid & ask, volume, average volume, market cap, beta, PE Ratio, EPS, and the 1y target estimate in order to compare the current day to the prior day. Additionally the reports will tell you if the stocks exceeded a predetermined tolerance in movement specific to each security, for example, if Nvidia changes in price by a dollar that is much less significant than if Apple changes by a dollar. If your tolerance for Apple is one dollar the report will tell you if Apple exceeded that change or not in three different time horizons including after hours, prior close to close, and open to close. You can configure different tolerances for each of these horizons. The report will tell you if the beta changes which is extremely important because the beta is volatility compared to the S&P 500 with a beta of one meaning the security is as volatile as the S&P 500. If a stock's volatility increases or decreases that will change an investors perspective on the stock in the future. The screenshots I’m saving are helpful because they serve as a backup so if I lose my data I still have it from the original source. If I want to try my hand at charting and that form of daily analysis I can, and that could help me find patterns that seem to repeat themselves for that given security.

In the future I will be finding a more efficient way of gathering the data so that you don’t have to input each number individually in addition to making the document look prettier. My next step for May will be to create end of month reports for these securities. I'm thinking of adding another. I haven’t decided on a company or an ETF, I’m thinking out of the tech sector to find something less or inversely correlated to the companies I’ve already chosen. I absolutely need to find a good way to get a price for daily high and daily low. Feel free to download the first package for April below, I hope you find it useful.

Poirier post coming soon…
