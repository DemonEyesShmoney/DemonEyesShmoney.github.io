# Calm before the Storm


I’ve made a bet with my girlfriend that she's taking Volk. I'm taking Topuria. The fight is tonight. At this point I don’t know why I’ve picked Topuria, I thought he had a good chance of winning but everyone doubts Volk but he's demon and he pulls it out, I’m still rooting for Topuria, but Topuria needs a bad version of Volk in order to win, and I think that last KO is going to slow Volk down. My official prediction for the main event is Topuria by decision.

The last pig, Nvidia, earnings are Thursday after market close. All of the A-listers have had their earnings; Google, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Netflix, and smaller companies like Palantir and DraftKings. Regardless of the direction Nvidia takes after its earnings I think the market is going to go through a big sell off now that earnings are coming to an end for this quarter. Except for one, all of my positions expire on or before March 15th so that I can get out and restategise my portfolio. The market has gone on seeing the S&P 500 close over 5000 for the first time which was certainly inflated by the performance of companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta since they are all amongst the S&P 500’s top holdings. 

I think a big sell-off is incoming and it’s a great time to realize gains in the market.

As for Nvidia itself, I keep going back and forth, it has a Market cap of 1.79 trillion (outstanding shares * share price) and just passed Amazon’s Market cap of $1.76T , they’re currently closing in on Google which is at 1.87T. I’ve been closely watching Nvidia for almost two years now, since last February the stock price has jumped after every earnings announcement. Next week is short due to the holiday so trading volume will be high in the time preceding earnings. I do think the stock is overpriced and the valuation doesn’t match the financials but the valuation didn’t match the financials during the previous earnings events either and the share price still jumped. My bullishness might fade causing me to rethink my position, but where I’m sitting now I’m confident in positioning myself for a big jump in the share price. I’m going to give an update this week before earnings since the situation is very fluid and the behavior of the stock on Tuesday and Wednesday could be very good indicators. My current Nvidia position is a combination of put credit spreads with varying expirations and strike prices and $880 calls that expire March 1st. I’m very confident in my put credit spreads, but I want to expose myself to higher possible returns with the calls even though they are riskier than the spreads.
