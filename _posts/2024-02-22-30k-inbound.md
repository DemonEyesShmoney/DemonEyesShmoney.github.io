# 30K INBOUND BABY

I want to talk about Topuria, Elden Ring, the market, and my portfolio; I’m going to wait until tomorrow or Saturday to see how I close out the week because I want to talk about it all. Today my portfolio returned 8.59% which means I’m up $2288.61 placing my portfolio value at $28,916.05, and because of all the after hours movement tomorrow morning I will most likely hit 30 fucking bands. I don’t want to jinx it so we’ll wait to see, today my big winner was Nvidia and tomorrow it’s going to be Block.

## Today's gains

This morning my Nvidia positions all hit about max profit after last night’s earnings, the estimate earnings was $4.63 per share and they beast it with $5.16. I did change my calls to spreads last minute on Wednesday, the 21st, in order to mitigate the drop in implied volatility caused by the earnings announcement. Implied volatility is almost always at its highest leading up to earning and plummets after earnings, when you buy options the drop in implied volatility will reduce the price of the option because implied volatility is calculated into the premium (price). My put credit spreads combined with my call debit spreads profited me $2,000 today.

Today before the market closed I thought I’d ride this climb and load up a Block position (SQ). Block was recommended to me by a friend, and he was bullish on their earnings today. The position expires tomorrow and it’s a call debit spread meaning I’m paying a premium to place a bet on the share price exceeding my selected strike price. I opened the position whilst the stock price was $67.50 and I bet that by tomorrow at 4pm the share price will exceed $68, after hours SQ is $77.50. I opened 4 of these call debit spreads for an average price of $190 each, after the price adjusted to the stock movement tomorrow morning each of them will be worth $500.

The market giveth today, my SPY, Google, Amazon, and QQQ all had excellent returns today. The only problem I had was Rivian dropped from $15.50 yesterday to $11.55 tonight. I'm still selling a put that I had to roll one out to a further date and sell another at $12.

Tomorrow is the big day! My next post we’ll celebrate all of the wins: Topuria, the Elden Ring DLC, and hopefully 30K.
