## Portfolio Management and Nvidia

These are some things I always keep in mind when trading and help me with my strategy.

1. I keep between 10% and 20% of my portfolio liquid, my ideal number is about $5,000 in cash. The first reason I do this is so I can take advantage of trade opportunities that present themselves in real time without having to close other positions.This can include buying the dip, hedging, or opening something new all together. The second is so I can withdraw it in case of emergencies, note that Robinhood has restrictions on withdrawals, but I’ll cover that at a different time.

2. Credit Spreads on SPY and QQQ with a delta of 0.14-0.24 on the put being sold are almost always in my portfolio, I frequently have success in these trades. I set them up to be two to four weeks until expiration and open $300 or $500 spreads. These trades do not take up much of my portfolio but they’re safe and reliable.

3. During earnings or if I’m expecting a massive movement in the share price in a stock where I have a large position I’ll create a low cost high payout hedge to mitigate losses by lowering my max profit. A hedge is just a new position that seemingly contradicts a current position that I’m holding. For example, a long put and a long call on the same company.

4. Stocks tend to have a buy rush before the market closes on red days especially with SPY and QQQ. The lowest point is rarely right at the end of the day.

5. Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta in that order are the 5 largest holdings of both SPY and QQQ. The performance of these indexes are extremely correlated to the performance of these companies, the price of these companies can serve as indicators for the indexes. As an example, if you’re expecting a large rally in Nvidia, bullish positions on SPY and QQQ could have a higher chance of success.


As for a quick portfolio update, we’re in deep with Nvidia across many expirations with the latest being June 21st. The stock price plummeted to $830 today but has been staggering back. I created a return profile which includes the maximum loss, maximum profit, along with the possible return on my portfolio as of 12:15 PM 4/9/2024. Most of my positions are Put Credit Spreads, however, all of my positions have varied levels of risk. I have some long shots and some more reasonable ones, but since the pull back I’ve become very worried for the future.

This is the table I created to display my live Nvidia positions. The file is downloadable so you can see the equations and build the table for your own positions.

These are all of the prices as of 12:15 PM 4/9/2024 to calculate the maximum return.

Just like always I’m not a financial advisor, this isn’t financial advice.
