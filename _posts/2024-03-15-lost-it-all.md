## How did we get here

![img-description](/assets/alltimelosses.png)

So TSM was dogshit and I off-loaed most of my position early in the week then in order to combat losses from my decaying TSM position I deposited $2,000 and tried to catch the falling knife that was QQQ. I opened some credit spreads with a max profit above a share price of 437, I rolled my position lower to 435 to no avail. Between TSM, Nvidia, and QQQ my portfolio is down $20,000 from its high of $39,000 last Friday. This is a clear example of poor diversification along with overtrading which caused me to magnify my losses.

I’m down and it’s really difficult creating this post, but my girlfriend said it was good to show your losses too because people always hide them which skews reality. I want to blame everything else, but it’s my fault. You should not be exposing your portfolio to risk like this, it is just stupid and I had all week to pull out and be smart, but I ignored my better judgment because I thought I could hit big. 

## You always lose at the casino

I’m gutted because I have no solid positions that I can use to take advantage of the inevitable bull run when the market recovers and I wasn’t holding nearly enough cash to place those positions before frantically trying to manage my current ones.

I still hold many TSM positions and ironically they could help me out of this hole. I still hold September calls on Google and Amazon. In the short term, I opened up 100 $1 put credit spreads on QQQ for Monday expiration, if it closes above 436 (currently 434) I’ll make $6,500 profit and if it’s under 435 I lose the $3,500 I put up. Additionally I bought a Nvidia debit spread for $760 that will balloon to a value of $5,000 if Nvidia hits $1,050 at the end of March. I'm only 20% confident in this position so if it is a flop I’ll sell it next week.

The worst part for me is that I didn’t listen to myself and everything that I’ve learned about the industry. I said that I wanted to transition to cash before 3/15 because I was anticipating a huge selloff and it happened and it burned 50% of my portfolio away. I was too susceptible to the mania, let my emotions get the better of me and went from finally being net positive on my account after 6 years to incurring my largest loss in one day to date, $9086.75, and delivering me to my all time portfolio low. As much as I want to say that this is the furthest down it will go, it probably isn't because people seem very afraid in the market right now; securities seem discounted but not cheap. The VIX is a measurement of the stock market’s expectation of volatility, if the VIX is high typically there is a lot of fear, if it’s low there’s minimal fear. The VIX is on its way up but not yet near any of the peaks in the past 30 days, which tells us there could be more of a fall.

As for the future I need to work on position sizing because before my position sizing was too small now it’s too big. Additionally I need to keep a log of my positions and my goals for those positions because I’m losing track of everything with my portfolio being so messy.. To be profitable in my portfolio it needs to have a value of $41,500. I will be coming up with a plan for future deposits and weekly/monthly income strategies. I still plan to hit 50k by next December but I just have to keep chugging along and play smart. 

Sorry about the somber update. I wish we had better news and I’m definitely not a financial advisor.
