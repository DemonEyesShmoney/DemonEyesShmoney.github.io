# Quick Followup on Netflix Post-Earnings


Just a quick update: Netflix jumped up almost $43, tomorrow Morning my spreads will likely go from a current price $1.2 per position to around $4.0, when selling credit spreads the value of the strategy must decay to $0.0 by expiration (February 16) for me to collect my entire premium of $94 per credit spread. For this to happen Netflix will have to go below $530 as of expiration, however for the time the price of my credit spread will jump up because of how early Netflix reached $533.

As for quarter 4 earnings Netflix slightly underperformed with an actual earnings of $2.11 per share compared to an estimated earnings of $2.22. As I stated in my previous post today Netflix would likely meet its estimate. The share price shot up and likely impressed shareholders showing that meeting expectations CAN be a great indicator for good earnings performance.  As for myself I’m glad I minimized my position, for this week I want to see the strength of these gains and whether or not they seem to hold. If a big sell off seems unlikely I’ll close my position for a loss. If the price of my position gets closer to the max loss of $500 per spread I may just hold to see what happens. If my level of certainty that Netflix will trend downward in the next couple of weeks I may even open some new bearish positions. If these gains in Netflix Stock hold I may open a put credit spread, which is simply the opposite of the call credit spread where you are betting the stock price will be greater than the strike price by a specific date. (Credit spreads mean you get a paid a credit which is the premium)
