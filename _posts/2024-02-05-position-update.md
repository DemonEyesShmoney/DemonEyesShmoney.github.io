# Diamond Hands

Dustin "The Diamond" Poirier, this dude is allergic to boring fights, he's one of my favorite fighters and I pay to see his fights. Last week he came out and said his UFC 299 fight with the surging #11 ranked Benoit Saint-Denis (BSD) was off, that same day he came out and said it was miscommunication and the fight was back on. I'm just itching to see this, Poirier who is ranked #3 and in his last 5 fights fought Mcgregor twice is lowering the ladder to give BSD a shot at breaking into the top 5; this is a savage ass move because Poirier is coming off of a head kick KO loss to Justin Gaethje and his first fight back is going to be against a dude who finished his last 5 opponents in under two whole rounds each, not to mention BSD no name to anyone except hardcore MMA fans. The question isn't who has the better resume because it's Poirier, the question is; can Dustin still hang with these young up and coming fighters, does he deserve to stay in the top 5 lightweights? The UFC knows how big of a star Poirier is because more people are excited about this fight than the main event which is O'Malley vs Chito. If this fight had fallen through 299 would be signifigantly less anticipated by casual and harcore fans. Unfortunately I do think BSD is going to get it done, but I'm rooting for Poirier and hope in this five round fight he can turn back the clock and put on a masterclass.

## My Portfolio As Of February 5th
![img-description](/assets/Positions0205.png)

As for my portfolio, February is already treating me better than January. I want to get the comments section working on my posts so that people can ask questions and we can get a discourse going. As for the portfolio I’ve become very bullish on Google and I’ve begun selling a put on it to collect premium instead of Amazon for the time being because I want to see if Amazon keeps booming or if it is going to cool off after earnings. However, I am still very bullish on Amazon and have decided to buy some calls for next September where I am predicting that Amazon will exceed a share price of $240, the time leading up to September will capture two more earnings events, which gives me relatively high confidence that $240 is reasonable considering Amazon’s previous earnings performance. I did need to close some of my Amazon positions to free up some cash for my new Google position, but in the long term I plan to grow my Amazon and Google positions together. A lesser known stock, Palantir (PLTR), beat its earnings estimate today which led to the stock climbing almost 20%. This is a stock I’ve been selling puts on regularly which has led to me owning shares and although the stock performed great today it’s typically one that I use to farm premium by selling puts and covered calls which I plan to continue doing as long as it seems profitable. Nvidia hit a 52 week high today which was great for my put credit spreads, so I will probably close those out before expiration in order to realize some gains. Hopefully I can give you an update at the end of the week to see how my Google position ends up looking at its expiration on February 9th.
