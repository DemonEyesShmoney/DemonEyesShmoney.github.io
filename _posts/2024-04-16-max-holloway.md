I went 7 and 13 on picks, Charles lost, I was wrong about the main event, but none of that matters because the night belonged to Max Holloway. The night Max lost to Volk the first time when Kamaru defended against Colby the first time was the first pay per view I ever watched live. Ever since then I’ve been on this journey waiting for Max to get his moment. I picked him in every fight with Volk, against every contender, Allen, Yair, Kattar, Zombie. Now I picked him on UFC 300, but deep down I was worried Gaethje was going to Tony him. After all that Max Holloway proved who he is, he’s a dog and he’s the BMF. This was one of the best moments in the sport that I’ve ever seen, it was his best performance in my opinion and those two men made the BMF belt, now I think it’s fucking badass, I used to think it was a little corny. Max’s performance was essentially perfect and then whilst coasting to a 3-1 decision he gave Gaethje the shot with 10 seconds left in the round he pointed to the ground and they started banging, but Max was way faster, he was low, Gaethje was high, and Max’s overhand right got there before Gaethje’s uppercut, then good night. It was amongst the best performances and finishes in UFC history against a guy who is on Mount Rushmore of dangerous and entertaining fighters. Max has his pick of the litter he can fight whoever he wants. I think he looks great at 155 with this new build and would love to see him chase superfights with the stars in that division, but I need to see him fight Topuria at some point if not next because that Chin ain't going nowhere!!!

The diversity of strikes that Max was throwing was insane; the jump back kick, push kick to the body and legs, and the combinations. Max is in his prime after losing the belt after several title defenses almost five years ago. He has combined his two styles before Volk he would stand in the pocket and bang like he did with Aldo and Lamas, after the second loss to Volk when he was fighting Kattar, Yair, and Allen he changed up his style and took fewer risks by being more measured and playing safer by using takedowns and range. Now after this fight he has perfectly incorporated both of his styles at the same time. It was cool that he gave Gaethje the chance right at the end of the fight, but I think that was actually way safer for Max than Justin, I think Max knew he was favored in a pocket slugout like that because he knew for the most part his chin was safe and Gaethje was already compromised he annihilated him, and the fact there was no bad blood and the two are friendly makes it more perfect because the two of them answered the call and proved that the BMF belt means something. This was a magical UFC moment and all fans and non fans can appreciate it for the chaotic beauty that it has. It is bittersweet because I really like Justin and he deserved a title shot after knocking Poirier out, plus it was just a little too much. It was an amazing ultimate highlight moment for Holloway, but it was so brutal for Gaethje. I hope Gaethje rests up and comes back for one last run at the title, and I hope they give him good fights like a rematch with Charles, one last run with Poirier, or a Mcgregor payday. I’d want to see a Mcregor payday for Holloway or Gaethje. Max has held the interim belt, the title, defended it, now won the BMF belt at a higher weightclass. He beat the pillow hand allegations.
