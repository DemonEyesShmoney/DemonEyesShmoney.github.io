# Francis Ngannou vs Joshua, Market updates, and UFC 299 Predictions

The market has been all over the place but I’m holding. Yesterday I posted on instagram showing how my portfolio was down $1,850 at the beginning of the day and largely recovering at the end of the day. I posted that because everyone, myself included, are susceptible to being affected emotionally by the market, sit back and don’t panic sell, some positions should be closed but it’s impossible to tell if it’s actually the right decision or if you’re panicked when you’re emotionally invested. It can go the other way as well, don’t get married to a position if you can save some money, close it, that can be better than banking on a comeback.

UFC 299 is absolutely stacked. Every fight on the main card and prelims are awesome with great name value. I’m really intrigued by the matchups and I think this card is almost as good as UFC 300. Here are my predictions for each fight.

Sean O’Malley vs Chito Vera

I think O’Malley is getting a victory by decision. Chito has an excellent chin but he’s a slow starter and I don’t see his grappling playing a huge factor. I think Chito can hurt him with a big shot, but I don't think Chito has the pace to really stifle Sean’s gameplan. I think Sean will probably outstrike him with most of the action at the end of each round when Chito picks up the volume.

Dustin Poirier vs Benoit Saint-Denis (BSD)

Poirier’s getting it done with a finish. It’s an extremely high risk fight, BSD finished four of his list five fights and hasn’t lost in the UFC. I think Poirier has a really good chance if his chin holds up, his boxing is way crisper, he’s got a star studded resume, he has lots of experience in southpaw vs southpaw matchups, and his grappling is good enough to get up and not get submitted by anyone outside of the best of the best. I think BSD is going to gas and get swallowed in the later rounds.

Kevin Holland vs Michael “Venom” Page (MVP)

Former Bellator champ MVP by KO/TKO. Kevin Holland is great to watch, but his skillset is extremely limited, even though the grappling will be non-existent, Holland was completely outclassed on the feet by a guy like Steven Thompson who is an excellent striker but lacks in the power department. MVP is an extremely dangerous fighter who can throw anything at any time, in Bellator he caved in Cyborg’s skull with a flying knee.

Gilbert Burns vs Jack Della Maddalena (JDM)

I want Gilbert to win but I think it’s going to be JDM by TKO. Gilbert's best chance is to overwhelm him with the grappling and threaten submissions whilst creating openings through the takedown threat. The reason I think JDM is going to win is because Gilbert is coming off of several injuries and I don’t know if he’s going to be the same. If he just tries to stand with JDM I think he’s going to get lit up, I think JDM has excellent boxing and will be able to keep it on the feet long enough to find the finish.

Petr Yan vs Song Yadong

Song Yadong by decision. Yan is on a four fight losing streak and his best rounds are four and five, this is a three round fight with an extremely young and hungry contender. I really like Yan and thought he beat O’Malley, I just don’t think he’s going to get any favors in a stacked division like bantamweight. I don’t think Yan is going to do enough to win a decision even if he has big moments.

Curtis Blaydes vs Jailton Almeida

Jailton Almeida KO/TKO. I think Blaydes is great, but he’s a gatekeeper. I think Jailton is going to be able to ride the top position, tire Blaydes out, and blast him with ground and pound. Blaydes’ best chance is to push Almeida against the fence and break him down with knees and clinch work.

Katlyn Chookagian vs Maycee Barber

Maycee Barber by KO/TKO. Chookagian is a solid fighter, very well rounded but she has minimal power and at 10 years the senior of Maycee Barber I think she’s getting run over. Chookagian is either getting finished or stomped out in a decision. If Chookagian can slow the fight down and score points from the outside she can get a decision. I think Maycee Barber is one fight away from a title after a win here.

Mateusz Gamrot vs Rafael dos Anjos (RDA)

Gamrot by decision because RDA is a little over the hill. This one is tough because they’re both very well rounded, very durable, lackluster power, but good cardio. I just think that RDA is on the way out and will be retiring soon whereas Gamrot is still on that title run in his mind and he extremely impressed me with his win over Arman. I think this fight is going to be close but I think it’s easier for Gamrot to get the decision than RDA.

Pedro Munhoz vs Kyler Philips

I’ve never seen Kyler fight but Pedro is pretty underwhelming and outside of his iron chin he’s a jack of all trades master of none. I’ll go Kyler by decision because Pedro is 37 as a bantamweight and can only be slowing down.

# Finally Francis vs Joshua is here!

Francis is knocking out Joshua. I’ll be honest I’m not super familiar with Joshua’s game, but one thing I have seen is that unlike Tyson Fury he struggles in coming back from a losing fight. If he gets rocked I can see him being less keen on throwing and becoming a much less threatening fighter. However, Francis needs to understand that there is a chance that Tyson Fury wasn’t taking the fight super seriously and wasn’t as prepared as Joshua will be. I don’t want to see Francis reckless, he needs to get into the fight and see what it looks like, but if he can drop Joshua once it’s a different fight entirely. I don’t think the gap in their physicalities is that wide, but I favor Francis’ chins, and when it comes to the power Francis’ is levels above.
