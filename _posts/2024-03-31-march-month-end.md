## March 2024 Month End

More bad news, but not too bad. March was a brutal month, where I experienced a massive 20k loss and a big 11k recovery. The last week of March was mediocre. I started the week at 30k but now I’m down to 27k. Like I said in previous entries, I returned to put credit spreads and I’m happy with many of my positions even though most of them have experienced losses last week. The securities I’m currently trading spreads on are Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Truth Social, Reddit, Target, TSM, QQQ, SPY, Apple, Google, and Netflix. I’ve greatly diversified the securities I’m trading this week in order to scope out some new potential plays.

I’ve become very taken with Microsoft especially. Microsoft is an extremely safe company, it makes up 8.74% of the holdings in QQQ and 7.07% the holdings of SPY, additionally it is the single largest holding for both. Microsoft is a growing company, and in my opinion it is a great choice to put credit spreads since they can profit off of a stock moving sideways, you don’t need massive price movement to make the max profit on your position. My current Microsoft position is a $410/$400 put credit spread, and I’m betting the share price will exceed $410 as of May 3rd, it currently sits at $419.90.

As for TSM I’m basically out of it. I opened some credit spreads, but I have closed all my calls at a loss. Perhaps I’ll make a new play before earnings but it’s doubtful at the moment.

My best positions of the week were $630/$640 call credit spreads betting Netflix will be below $630 on April 5th. The gains haven’t been realized but I've set a limit order for $0.45 per position tomorrow morning which will lock in a profit of $356. When the market opens the option price will adjust even if the stock price stays the same due to theta decay. Theta is one of the variables used in options pricing, it is the one correlated with the value the option will lose as expiration gets closer.

This week or next I plan on posting what my current criteria is for taking a position, in addition to some things I think about each week.This includes what I look for in order to hedge, general portfolio building, and how to choose a strike price.

Just like always I’m not a financial advisor, this isn’t financial advice.
