# Portfolio Update and Tax Loss Harvesting Tips

## My Portfolio Since January 1st 2024
![img-description](/assets/portupdate.png)

I want to share an update on my portfolio’s lack of progress through the first month of the year along with a couple tax tricks that are completely legal. 

As you can see with my portfolio since January 1st I’m down 8.15% about $2,100 this has been a dagger to the balls in layman's terms. If I realize these losses, meaning I close the losing positions I can deduct this loss from my capital gains (realized portfolio profits) to reduce my tax liabilities.

Let’s say I’ve realized my losses of $2,100 and at the end of 2024 my capital gains are $5,000. I am only responsible for paying taxes on the remaining $2,900. That $2,100 that I lost is relevant this year because I closed the positions this year. If I lost $2,900 in 2023 and didn't close the position until 2024 then I could use that loss in 2024, I would have no taxable gains in 2024 because it only matters when you close the position. 

So $5,000 in 2024 - $2,100 in 2024 - $2,900 in 2023 but closed in 2024 = $0 in taxable gains.

Now let’s take a step back, imagine my realized losses in 2024 are $2,100 and I have no capital gains on my portfolio. I can deduct that $2,100 from my regular taxable income that I make at my job. If I make $100,000 a year I’m only responsible for taxes on $97,900 (100k - 2100). You can only deduct a maximum of $3,000 per year from your taxable income using realized losses, however, if you realized a loss of $6,000 in 2024 you can carry over the remaining loss of $3,000 into 2025 even if you have no other realized losses in 2025.

As for my portfolio, I’ve been overtrading, and getting in my head, I’ve had losses trading options on Tesla, Netflix, Google, and Nvidia; I’ve been closing many of my positions at a loss and earnings time has been killing me this quarter. My current earnings play is with Amazon, I’ve bought 50 shares, their earning is after the market closes on the 1st of February. Buying shares is a bullish strategy and I hope the stock shoots up, however, I’m holding enough cash to buy another 50 shares and get me to 100. Why don’t I buy the shares now? It’s true that if Amazon shoots up after earnings I’ll be kicking myself for not buying more, however, if I do buy those shares before earnings it’s a coin flip because if the stock plummets I’ll get killed. My plan is that if Amazon goes down I can buy the remaining 50 shares at a great discount, and if it looks like Amazon is shooting up I can still get in because you can trade stocks after hours unlike options. Amazon is a stock I want to be involved in long term no matter what the earnings report looks like tomorrow night, my price target for Amazon as of next December is $230 so the cheaper I can get it the better. The reason I closed my short put on Amazon is because it positions myself before earnings meaning that the stock needs to go up, yet my potential profits are limited to the exact premium of the put mean that once the stock goes up, after a certain point my gains will max out and even if the stock goes up past that point my profits will stay the same. Owning the shares exposes me to higher possible gains, along with the backup plan of buying more shares if Amazon takes a hit after earnings.

This still is not financial advice and I’m still not a licensed advisor
