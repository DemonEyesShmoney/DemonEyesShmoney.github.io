# Rebounds and Turnarounds

Today my girlfriend and I will be celebrating Superbowl sunday with a Sushi dinner in the city, I don't like Sushi or Football, but I love Japanese Cuisine so we should be covered.

Next weekend, the real sporting event, UFC 298: Undeafeated Ilia Topuria will be taking on the 145 pound champ Alexander Volkanovski. These boys have been talking shit back and forth, both of them are so confident and one of them is going to be so embarassed Sunday morning. Normally I'd be taking Volk all day but he just got KOed with a head kick in his last fight when he fought Islam Makhachev for the 155 pound belt on short notice and I don't know if his chin has recovered. In adittion to that, Volk is getting up there, at 36 we need to see if he can defend his belt one more time. The record of UFC fighters over the age of 35 in title fights between the weightclasses of 125 and 170 are 2 victories and 31 losses. Volk is fighting against the odds and I just want the loser of the fight to get finished just becasue it will elevate the winner so much.

Onto business, my portfolio has recovered from last week and I'm into profit now for 2024 and hopefully we can keep this success going. My big winners have been Amazon, Nvidia, Google, and Palantir. With Amazon and Palantir most of the gains game from shares and selling puts for premium. Nvidia is my spread farmer where I sell put credit spreads for premium betting the stock will go up. Google is my new play that I want to start getting into, it's sideways and slightly upward trend is excellent for selling puts. The only problem is due to the amount of cash I need to collateralize for 100 shares I can only sell a put on either Amazon or Google, I have $13,000 in cash and at the end of the week some of my positions are expiring and by then I will have selected either Google or Amazon, I'll let you all know at the end of the week.
