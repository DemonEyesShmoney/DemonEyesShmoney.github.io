## The Green Curtain

![img-description](/assets/greencurtain.png)

Analysis of the Russian economy is a difficult task due to minimal transparency and enduring obfuscation. Investment banks have been known to mark Russian securities as worthless since there is no way to evaluate their financials or forecast their future. According to the Moscow times the loan rates, the cost of borrowing, had risen to a maximum of 44% as of November 19th. During October Russian banks issued 1.94 million cash loans totalling $3.06 billion which is 43% less than last year. Since the pandemic Russian bank customers have fallen to the lowest level, in the first 8 months of 2024 the amount of defaulters was approximately 6.2 million with 800,000 Russian going overdue on payments. As a result the Central Bank of Russia has raised its key policy rate by 2% at once to a record of 21% per annum since 2003.
Traditionally interest rates are increased to combat inflation, in this case the increase in rates for borrowers is likely to accommodate for liquidity shortages caused by growing rates in defaults, late payments, and a decrease in loan issuance by Russian banks. These increases in the costs of borrowing will result in higher rates of defaults from borrowers only magnifying liquidity shortages. When liquidity fears grow people will rush to withdraw their money because of bank insolvency fears, this is called a “Bank Run”, which is a known cause for banks collapsing. With Russia overextended in Ukraine and suffering domestically from a stagnating economy Putin’s failures are becoming too difficult to hide and sooner or later the Russian government will need to tackle these problems as opposed to obscuring them because the house of cards that Putin has built is wobbling.
