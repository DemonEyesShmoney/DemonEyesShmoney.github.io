We’ve gotta stop meeting like this, another month, another slaughter. I’ve got no one to blame but myself. Between ambitious earnings plays, poor diversification, assignments, and a volatile market I managed to devastate my portfolio with a loss of 47.47% in April. The last few months have been brutal. On March 1st my portfolio was worth $31202.66, $27,015.8 on April 1st, and now 16190.86 on May 1st. Wth the way my portfolio is performing I can’t justify future deposits for a while. With these past few months turning out how they have, I’ve completely thrown off my goal of 50K at the end of the year. Losses came predominantly from Meta, Netflix, Microsoft, and Nvidia with Google and Amazon remaining reliable as always. Google and Amazon seem like the best things for spreads and shares especially at the moment, I'm thinking about some long term leap call options on them, but I'll have to find the right entry.

At this time I’m keeping my exposure super low, with a little under 13K in cash. I’m hoping I can find better opportunities, but the main reason I’m super liquid right now is because I can’t really deal with the stress. I've nuked my portfolio to the point where I can’t really sell cash secured puts on Amazon or Google. In addition to that, I have no idea where the market is going. I’m super jaded because I’m interested in the stock market and I thought I had a good aptitude for options, but I always make the same mistake and buy into the hype, poorly diversify my positions, and then sell at a huge loss. I started trading six years ago, and 2023 was my only positive year. Even this year with the TSM and Nvidia run I went to all time positive on the portfolio for about 20 minutes. I work a 9-5 and every month I deposit at least 2K into my portfolio in hopes of growing it, but my portfolio’s value is lower than it was on November 1st. This just isn't sustainable and if I want to actually grow my wealth I can’t justify continuing to put it into the market so for now we’re gonna see what I can do with what I have left. I want to be more consistent with updates on my positions even losers because I’ve been a little too laid back these past couple of weeks.

In other news, my financial reporting project that I’ve been working on is going well and I’m going to make my April reports available on the website for free as soon as they’re done so you guys can take a look or make them yourselves. I plan on releasing them every month, as of now I am cataloging data from my most traded stocks which are Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, SPY, QQQ, and Tesla. This analysis that I’m doing looks at daily price movement, after hours movement, weekly performance, etc. I’ll have a post coming out this weekend with the reports and some thoughts of mine. I’m currently working on a post about an assignment on Robinhood which is difficult due to the unpredictability of it, but I’m hoping to have that out for you guys soon.

Just like always I’m not a financial advisor, this isn’t financial advice.
