# Clawing Back

![img-description](/assets/maymonthend05.31.2024.png)

We’re on our way to a big turnaround. Mcdonald’s, Amazon, Netflix, and SPY were the main stocks that got me out of the dark ages of the $10,000 range. I’m at $22,575.70 today which is an increase of 39.43% from May 1st with no deposits. Hopefully during June, I’ll be able to get above 25K and get day trades back which will increase my trade safety immeasurably. Currently when I place a trade I’m locked in, I can’t close until the next day which opens me up to vulnerability against huge changes in share price intraday or after hours. Once I get day trades back I’ll be able to close whenever I need to, and I’ll be able to make trades that take advantage of intraday movement. Best case scenario by the end of June I’ll be back on track for my portfolio goals. After having a -26.24% return in March and a -47.47% return in April, it was invigorating to have a 35.86% return in May. To be on track for July 1st I’ll need to have a 63.21% return in June which is extremely bold, but I’m going to try to keep it safe especially since I’m expecting a huge pullback in the market this month.

The big Friday SPY dump ballooned my 5/31 520/523 put debit spreads I opened the day before and I was able to make out like a bandit before the market had its huge recovery at the end of the day. I had been trying to make a Netflix play work for a while as I was seeing its massive recovery and surge after earnings. I saw it in the 660s and opened 6/7 635/640 call credit spreads to take advantage of a pull back in the share price. I wish I held it longer, but I was extremely happy with some gains when I sold at $646.30 on Thursday.

Amazon was very successful for me in the last two weeks, I noticed Amazon fluctuating between $179 and $185 so I opened the 185/180 put credit spreads at $180 and closed it when the share price went to $183-$184, I did this, successfully profiting, three times before shifting down and opening 3 new put credit spreads at 180/175 which I still hold now. They are currently at a loss, but I think between now and June 21st Amazon will rally above $180, if it goes down I may even open more or shift down again to the 175/170 put credit spread, remember with put credit spreads you want the share price to go above the put with the higher strike price by expiration.

Mcdonald’s has been my dark horse, it’s a solid company with decent volume. I’m not certain about this so don’t take my word for it, but it always seems like Mcdonald’s is up when the tech sector and SPY is down. I’ll have to do more research and maybe add it to the financial reports. The position like normal is a put credit spread that. I opened most of these when the share price got down to $250-$252, so I got a high credit for them. They have been decaying quickly since the stock had a big recovery on Friday which held today. I'm looking to get out of this soon to lock in profits, if the spread gets to $0.75 or lower I’ll close it. I think Mcdonald’s is a great buy at $250, and if it goes down there I’ll likely open another 255/250 or lower put credit spread.

As for Nvidia and it’s 1 to 10 split this Friday, June 7th, I’m looking for a good entry price because I think a huge dump is hitting Nvidia specifically. I think the stock will go back down to $950 or $95 post-split before the next earnings report. Long story short I’m keeping my eyes out for an entry.

The financial report for May is very behind schedule, but I hope to get it uploaded soon. I have been working on new features including a new way to catalog the data which will make it significantly easier to manipulate in the future.

## As for the Diamond

Dustin Poirier and Islam Makhachev saved the night by putting on an all time great title fight. I had it 2 to 2 going into the fifth, but I thought Islam scored a 10-8 in the first round, meaning Dustin was down on points. Although Islam definitely had Staph he seemed a step ahead until round four where it looked like Dustin was starting to break him, Dustin’s shots were starting to get through, he was stopping takedown after takedown, and he opened Islam’s face up with some elbows. Dustin finally started getting comfortable and getting respect from Islam, he looked to be getting a second wind. Now that his jab was landing and he could stay up he knew he could start exposing Islam’s cut more and work to a finish. Going into that fifth it was anyone’s fight and Dustin looked to be winning the round so far, but Islam caught the leg, waited for a punch, Islam whipped Dustin’s leg to sweep him to the floor, then rushed onto him locking up a D’arce choke to finish the fight. It was a certified banger and Dustin has no reason to be upset. This fight was looking to be a one-sided demolition from Islam, but Poirier gave him the biggest challenge of his career. I wish he got to get that undisputed title but it doesn’t matter Dustin can go off to retirement as a great man with a great family, one of the best resumes of all time, and a better fighter than most champions.

Just like always I’m not a financial advisor, this isn’t financial advice.
