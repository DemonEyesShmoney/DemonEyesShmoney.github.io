# Clawing Back

![img-description](/assets/maymonthend05.31.2024.png)

We’re on our way to a big turnaround. Mcdonald’s, Amazon, Netflix, and SPY were the main stocks that got me out of the dark ages of the $10,000 range. I’m at $22,575.70 today which is an increase of 39.43% from May 1st with no deposits. Hopefully during June, I’ll be able to get above 25K and get day trades back which will increase my trade safety immeasurably. Currently when I place a trade I’m locked in, I can’t close until the next day which opens me up to vulnerability against huge changes in share price intraday or after hours. Once I get day trades back I’ll be able to close whenever I need to, and I’ll be able to make trades that take advantage of intraday movement. Best case scenario by the end of June I’ll be back on track for my portfolio goals. After having a -26.24% return in March and a -47.47% return in April, it was invigorating to have a 35.86% return in May. To be on track for July 1st I’ll need to have a 63.21% return in June which is extremely bold, but I’m going to try to keep it safe especially since I’m expecting a huge pullback in the market this month.

The big Friday SPY dump ballooned my 5/31 520/523 put debit spreads I opened the day before and I was able to make out like a bandit before the market had its huge recovery at the end of the day. I had been trying to make a Netflix play work for a while as I was seeing its massive recovery and surge after earnings. I saw it in the 660s and opened 6/7 635/640 call credit spreads to take advantage of a pull back in the share price. I wish I held it longer, but I was extremely happy with some gains when I sold at $646.30 on Thursday.

Amazon was very successful for me in the last two weeks, I noticed Amazon fluctuating between $179 and $185 so I opened the 185/180 put credit spreads at $180 and closed it when the share price went to $183-$184, I did this, successfully profiting, three times before shifting down and opening 3 new put credit spreads at 180/175 which I still hold now. They are currently at a loss, but I think between now and June 21st Amazon will rally above $180, if it goes down I may even open more or shift down again to the 175/170 put credit spread, remember with put credit spreads you want the share price to go above the put with the higher strike price by expiration.
