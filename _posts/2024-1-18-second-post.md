Every UFC pay-per-view (PPV) has been numbered in addition to some non PPV events. UFC 100 had one of the goats GSP, Hendo, and Brock Lesnar, Michael Bisping; all legends, all former champs. UFC 200 had to be fixed last minute because Jon Jones popped for the drug test so DC fought Anderson Silva instead Aldo was on the card, along with Brock, Cain and Mike Hunt. Brock’s fight with Mike got overturned because Brock was juiced up, and Mike sued the UFC stating that the company knew Brock was on it but wanted him to fight anyways for the card. Now with UFC 300 the card is loaded with some of the most anticipated fights coming up. It has just been announced that Max Holloway will be taking on Justin “The Highlight” Gaethje. This fight is a fight fan’s wet dream, both men have star studded resumes and are known for their wars. Gaethje is known for his power and his finishes whereas Hollaway is known for his chin and his volume. The problem with this fight is Holloway is moving up to lightweight (155 lbs) from featherweight (145 lbs), in his last outing at lightweight he took on #3 ranked Dustin Poirier who battered Holloway in a 5 round war. The best moment of that fight was in between rounds 4 and 5 where Holloway and Poirier both agreed to end the break in between rounds early to continue the fight. Gaethje and Holloway are fighters who always entertain the fans and are absolutely allergic to a boring fight. This is a dangerous fight for both fighters since they are both on the brink of a title fight in their respective divisions. Both of these men have decided to put it all on the line, with each man’s future title contention being contingent on victory. This is one of those fights that you could show someone who has never seen a fight before and they will give you one of two reactions, the first being absolute disgust at the bloodbath, and the second being absolute investment in the outcome of the fight. Both men are at the tops of their divisions and if they retire now or anytime in the future they will surely make it into the UFC Hall of Fame.

Risk is an aspect of every choice you make. With Investing there are different ways for an investment to be risky, two examples of this are systematic risk and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the market as a whole, whereas unsystematic risk is the risk of a particular company or industry. A metric we use in finance to determine the systemic risk of a portfolio or security is Beta also known as the correlation coefficient. Beta represents your corelation to the market typically the S&P 500, Beta operates on a spectrum:

A security with a Beta of 1 is perfectly correlated to the volatility of the S&P 500 meaning that an increase in the market will lead to a proportional increase in the security, same with a decrease in the S&P 500. This means a security with a Beta of 1 is just as risky as the market.

A security with a Beta of 0 is not necessarily underperforming the S&P 500 only that it is not correlated to the S&P 500.

A security with a Beta of -1 is inversely correlated to the S&P 500 so a day where the S&P 500 is up the security with a Beta of -1 would be down.

Securities with a Beta greater than 1 or less than -1 are more extreme in their reactions to the S&P 500. The security with a Beta of 1.5 would be higher than the S&P 500 on days the S&P 500 up, but would also be down  lower than the S&P 500 when the S&P 500 is down.

It is important to be correlated to the S&P 500 because the market is among the best investments for reliable returns year over year for the last 50 years, essentially every portfolio manager tries to have some if not all of his portfolio correlated to the S&P 500.

In the future we’ll discuss portfolio Beta in deeper detail including a Beta analysis of my portfolio. Many portfolios including my own want to benefit from the market so they either target a portfolio Beta of 1 or they can target stocks with a Beta of 1, most managers will apply both tactics. Amazon (AMZN) is an excellent choice, it has a 5 year monthly Beta of 1.16 according to Yahoo Finance which is a great source for technical analysis. We know it’s correlated to the market, yet slightly more extreme, so on most days the market is up Amazon will be up marginally higher and on days the market is down Amazon will go a little lower. Tesla on the other hand has a 5 year monthly Beta of 2.32 according to Yahoo Finance meaning it’s correlated to the market but significantly more extreme in its reaction to the market.

What can Amazon and Tesla’s Beta tell us?

Both are companies that promise high growth except Amazon is a company that we want a higher investment compared to Tesla because your level of certainty on the future performance of Amazon is higher than your level of certainty in Tesla.

Beta is an important tool for technical analysis but nothing works as a single indicator for deciding what to trade.
