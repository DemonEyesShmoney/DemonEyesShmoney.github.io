## Big QQQ Win and recovery path

Monday was a great day on the market especially early, even TSM was off to a great start. I was able to offload several positions up or at least at a minor loss which allowed me to restructure my portfolio. My big winner was the 100 $1 QQQ put credit spreads: I profited $5,794 off of a $3,500 investment with 0 days to expiration. Unfortunately, I didn’t collect the entire $6,500 even though QQQ exceeded the max profit price of $436 because Robinhood will attempt to close your QQQ positions that expire at close after 3:30. The close price of each spread was $0.07, there were 100, and remember to multiply by 100 for options contracts totalling to $700. With put credit spreads you sell a put and buy a put of a lower strike price with the same expiration to collect a premium, I collected $0.65 per position which totals to $6,500.

So ($65 * 100) - ($7 * 100) - ($6 * 2) Robinhood Fee = $5,794 Premium Collected

Since I do not use margin Robinhood lets me collateralize cash to open my put credit spreads. The collateral is released back to you if the position is a success, and if it's a loss the losses are deducted from the collateral. The amount of collateral is determined by the size of the spread minus the premium and the remainder is the necessary collateral. The size of the spread is the distance between strike prices of the put you sold and the one you bought, in my case it was a $1 spread because I sold the $436 and bought the $435 put. 

So ($1 - $0.65) * 100 * 100 = $3,500 Necessary Collateral

This was a desperately needed stimmy pack, I was up about $7,000 on my portfolio at close. I am rallying from my losses, and plan to keep things a little less risky moving forward. Put credit spreads are my most successful strategy and I have opened some on Nvidia, Netflix, QQQ, SPY, and Amazon to hopefully collect some more premium before the end of the month.
