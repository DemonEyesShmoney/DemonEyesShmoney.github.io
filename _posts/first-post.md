# The Predator Francis Ngannou, the Roth IRA, and the AMZN short put

After shocking everyone in October with an unprecedented performance from an MMA fighter against a Boxer, Francis Ngannou has landed a fight in March against Anthony Joshua. I’m so excited for this fight, I’ve been a fan of Francis since he knocked out the undefeated Jairzinho Rozenstruik in 12 seconds in May of 2020. Since then he has become the undisputed Heavyweight champion of the UFC. This guy has the motivation and belief in himself like none other and he went from someone who was seen as a “how far can he get” fighter to a “how far will he go” fighter. As for the fight, as long as he puts in the hours and goes into the fight the way he looked against Fury I think he’ll be too much for Joshua. Francis has the chin and the power, Joshua has the technique and the experience. However, Francis showed how effective of a boxer he was against Tyson Fury, the top ranked Heavyweight on the planet at the time of their first fight. As for the cardio we’ll have to see on the night, Francis has been exhausted in his prior fights, but he has shown dramatic improvements in fighting against adversity since his first fight against Stipe Miocic in 2018. I believe it makes sense for Joshua to be the favorite given his status as a boxer, but I desperately want Francis to win so the story can continue into a rematch with Fury and a fierce return to MMA.

Shortly before the end of the year I started serious financial planning for my future by opening a Roth IRA and making the maximum contribution which at the time was $6,500. There are contribution requirements: You cannot contribute to it if you make more than $161,000 or if you’re married with a joint income of $240,000 or more. Additionally, you can contribute up to $7,000 starting in 2024, unless you're 50 and older then you can contribute an additional $1,000. The benefits of a Roth IRA is you pay taxes on the money going in then are free from any taxes when you withdraw money from the account, unlike a traditional IRA there is no requirement to withdraw. Since I already manage my own portfolio my IRA is currently being managed by the bank so I don’t end up making the same mistakes on both portfolios. Once I’m ready to start withdrawing money from the Roth the capital gains on my investments will be exempt from taxes. You can manage it or a fund manager can manage the Roth for you. If you choose to have a manager manage your portfolio you have access to different strategies or risk tolerances depending on your preferences so it isn’t totally out of your hands either. Financially speaking a Roth IRA is in a category of its own because of the unique tax benefits it provides. A Roth IRA is excellent because it will protect you if you make it to a higher tax bracket in the future, and we all hope to be in a higher tax bracket. 

How does the Roth IRA protect you?

If you invest $1,000 without a Roth IRA in the S&P 500 and after ten years that investment grew to $2,500 you would then have to pay taxes on that $1,500 you made in profit.

The same person who went out to set up a Roth IRA and makes that same $1,000 investment into the S&P 500 will get to keep the entire $2,500 that the investment is worth after those ten years.

My largest position I’ve ever held will be expiring on Friday January 26th, fourteen and a half thousand thousand dollars. It’s most of my portfolio, but I’m confident because this position is a win-win. On expiration $145 is the number: If the price is higher I hit my max profit by collecting a full premium, if it will buy a hundred shares at $145. Amazon is amongst the seven best tech stocks to invest in; pension funds, endowments, hedge funds, investment banks, and sovereign wealth funds across the world all hold Amazon. This is the largest single investment I’ve made, making Amazon the backbone of my portfolio. Amazon is a great stock that can take advantage of multiple strategies including purchase of common stock, short puts, and put credit spreads.

It isn’t all about saving, dollars are just freedom tickets. If you want to be able to enjoy life on your terms you need money now and as you grow old. What’s the point in being miserable now so you’re secure when you’re older or losing all your money now and having nothing prepared for the future. My girlfriend and I recently made a plan to get away from work and go snowboarding for a weekend. We're going to a hotel that she used to go to with her family whilst growing up. I’d love to take her to Dubai or Greece but it’s a little too expensive and we don’t want to take that time off work right now. I’m so excited to go, we’ll be able to have our own space for a weekend with no distractions and it’s our first trip we’ve gone on that’s just the two of us. 

Next time I want to talk about credit cards and the future of the heavyweight division along with some portfolio updates.
