# Happy Memorial Day

## Poirier vs Makhachev

Dustin got the fight, he threaded the needle Gaethje lost to Max, Arman turned down the title shot because the fight was in under two months, Islam wanted to fight in June and the only option was the Diamond. Dustin is getting to retire from any fight now and the fact that he beat Beniot against all odds to get a last shot at the title that seems out of reach for him after his loss to Gaejthe is just a fairytale setup. Dustin‘s one of my favorites fighters but I’m not delusional, he’s a massive underdog in this fight. Islam is coming off of 3 all-time great wins, both victories over Volkanovski and his ugly dismantling of Charles Oliviera. Dustin‘s last win was legendary, but before that he got head kicked by Gaethje, and in his fight with Benoit he was getting manhandled for a shit load of the fight. I think this is a terrible stylistic matchup for Dustin between the fear of being taken down or head kicked. I think Dustin could be open to Islam’s game considering his wrestling and kickboxing. Dustin’s best chance is to stay dangerous in the fight as long as he can keep it on the feet, in the pocket, and stay active in striking exchanges. Dustin has a good chin and he can definitely score knockdowns if not KOs, but if he gives up his back like he always does, he will get subbed and if all of Dustin‘s title fights end in a loss by a rear naked choke it’ll be such a disappointment. Islam will probably win any way he wants and get a free title defense, but I’m going Dustin 3rd round KO. It’s a shame to say, this could be Dustin’s last fight win or lose and I’ll be sad if he retires, but I hope he stays retired. I hate seeing the fighters go too long taking damage and losses they don’t need to like Anderson Silva.

## Costa vs. Strickland

As for Paulo Costa vs. Sean Strickland, I'm excited that Paulo is actually fighting, and  this is a pretty good matchup. Strickland is active and always game which is probably his best quality. I’m definitely in the minority for saying this, Paulo Costa is beating Sean Strickland. Paulo brought hell to Whittaker in their last fight and was in extremely good shape, he’s not the best middleweight but he can generate big moments similar to DDP. My problem with picking Paulo is that I think there’s a huge chance he hurts Strickland badly, but I’ve seen Paulo fumble some possible finishes like with Rockhold and the wheel kick with Whittaker. I think Strickland will certainly win a decision if it goes that far, his defense and activity are both great and he’s not a stranger to five rounders. Ultimately, I think Costa will get through and win by TKO before trying to get a title shot.

The portfolio is doing ok, I’m up $2,800 on the week, but there’s a long way to go. As for the financial reports I’m very behind this month even though I have been working to optimize the excel and added another stock. My positions are a mixed bag right now, they are listed below, hopefully we’ll be seeing another good week. Like always, I’m big on Amazon.
